### Frontend Web Developer 👩‍💻

Hey there, I'm Inês and I love creating new things. I've been working as a Frontend Web Developer since February 2022. I'm a very active person and from a young age, I learned how to define priorities and manage time. I played volleyball for 18 years and always liked to enjoy the time between seasons to travel the world. To combine my interests, in my free time, I like to develop some mobile apps to simplify my daily life.
